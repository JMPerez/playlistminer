# CrowdLister

CrowdLister is a web app that creates Spotify playlists based upon matching
keywords.  

Give CrowdLister a keyword or two like "workout" or "happy" and CrowdLister will
find as many Spotify playlists that match those keywords. It will then aggregate
all of the songs across all of these playlists and find the top 100 songs that occur the
most frequently in the matching playlist. These top songs can then be saved
to your own playlist.

Crowdlister is online at TBD

It makes use of the Spotify Web API.
